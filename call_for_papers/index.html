                <p>The Digital Government Society (DGS) announces the 25th Annual International Conference on Digital Government Research - dg.o 2024, with the theme <b>"Internet of Beings: Transforming Public Governance"</b> in Taipei, Taiwan on June 11-14, 2024.</p>
                <p>The conference’s main host is the Department of Political Science &amp; the Graduate Institute of Public Affairs, College of Social Sciences, at the National Taiwan University. The conference is also co-hosted by the Department of Public Administration at the National Chengchi University, the Department of Public Administration at the Chung Hua University, and the Taipei City Government.</p>
                <p>The dg.o conferences are an established forum for presentation, discussion, and demonstration of interdisciplinary research on digital government, civic engagement, technology innovation, applications, and practice. Each year, the conference brings together scholars recognized for the interdisciplinary and innovative nature of their work, their contributions to theory and practice, their focus on important and timely topics, and the quality of their writing.</p>

                  <h4>THEME &amp; TRACK TOPICS:</h4>
                  </div>
                  <p>The 25th Annual International Conference on Digital Government Research (dg.o 2024) will feature the main theme of <b>"Internet of Beings: Transforming Public Governance."</b> The conference's central theme – the Internet of Beings focuses on digital technologies that enable integration, are people-centric, and the creation of open platforms for collaborative multi-user to co-create services and products. Especially, the post-COVID-19 has forced government, private, and non-profit agencies worldwide to find new ways to deliver services. The workforce shifts to remote working partially or entirely; agencies reconfigure services and the supply chains according to uncertain demand; agencies create new services for addressing delivery needs in both the public and private sectors. Digital technologies played an essential role in enabling these changes. However, adoption in the public sector needs to be more cohesive.</p>
                  
                  <p>Hence, the dg.o 2024 conference can help bridge the 'digital' gaps among different sectors in various countries and regions. Further, the theme of the conference aims to attract studies to bring the benefits of digital technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI), hybrid intelligence, blockchain, open platforms, the internet of things (IoT), wearable devices, big data, etc., have long been experienced holistically and compressively. In this respect, the conference will serve as a catalyst and bring a greater focus on integration, collaboration, and value creation. The conference will organize topics that showcase new technologies and help pinpoint where governments can achieve the most significant value.</p>

                  <div id="track1" class="collapse multi-collapse"><p>The track delves into the transformative landscape shaped by the integration of emerging digital technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning algorithms, within diverse governmental domains. This track takes a process-oriented perspective to understand the nuanced and profound impacts of data-driven and algorithm-intensive governance in public organizations. While concerns about fairness and discrimination in algorithm-assisted decision-making are evident, this track also addresses the potential for algorithms to mitigate human limitations and enhance administrative efficiency. By exploring the transition from traditional Weberian bureaucracy to a system-augmented algorithmic bureaucracy, the track aims to decipher the intricate dynamics underpinning this evolution. Understanding the interplay between human and algorithmic capabilities becomes crucial as autonomous intelligent agents play a pivotal role in public organizations. This track aims to discuss the macro-level conditions, meso-level adaptations, and micro-level human competency improvements, propelling a dynamic and comprehensive dialogue on the future of human-AI collaboration in government.</p></div>

                  <p>The pace of AI adoption in governments has continued to grow at different levels of government and across different domains including in particular social protection and welfare, public order and safety, environmental and natural resource protection, health, pubic services, housing and education. However, the emergence and rapid diffusion of generative AI applications in society has led to a growing consensus for developing better AI safety practices and the need for comprehensive regulatory policies to address potential threats that these new AI applications pose to citizens. In response, there is a growing stock of AI Governance frameworks and tools to support not only AI developers but also AI practitioners in government organisations to ensure the responsible development and deployment of AI in transforming public services and policymaking. However, empirical studies of government use of AI technologies are sparse. Hence, the purpose of this track is to investigate how AI is being developed, implemented and adopted in governments at different levels, what AI is adding to governments, how the institutional contexts are shaping AI use in government, and how to ensure that AI adoption in government remains safe and beneficial to the public at large.</p>

                    <p>The “Beyond Bureaucracy” track explores innovations in e-government and e-democracy that place the citizen at the center of governance. While traditional lines of inquiry at the intersection of politics and technology focus on enhancing or supporting existing political institutions, there is an underexplored opportunity for citizens to use technology to shape the public sphere and to control government more directly. Internet optimists have long anticipated new, digital models of self-governance, including representative, direct, liquid, anarchic models. Critics have argued that technology cannot safely or desirably support greater citizen involvement. This track covers all aspects of direct, futuristic, radical, exploratory, and critical approaches to digital governance. These include the (un)desirability of using technology to support citizen self-governance; challenges to self-governance through technology; theoretical and empirical proposals; assessments of technologies to support governance; the impact of developing digital phenomena on self-governance (misinformation, bots, digital collective intelligence); and the ethical, technological, social, and political implications of existing and potential future models of public governance. The track also welcomes research and case studies on the innovative uses of technologies by NGOs and other non-government actors. The “Beyond Bureaucracy” track serves as a platform for pro/contra deliberations on the near and distant challenges and potentials of e-democracy.</p>

                    <p>The collaborative intelligence track aims to investigate how human, crowd, and machine can complement each other to enhance public services and policies, such as healthcare services, citizen-government communication, bias and discretion reduction, smart city planning, etc. However, while the adoption of AI may enhance the citizens’ participation experience, there are potential ethical issues and implementation challenges in designing an optimal collaborative intelligence that includes both human collective intelligence and artificial intelligence. The collaborative intelligence track invites researchers and practitioners to accumulate scholarly papers that explore the interactions of human, crowd, and/or machine. Possible topics include strategies for collaborative intelligence or platforms in the public sector, designs for machine and human interaction in public services or policy making, comparisons of outputs and bias from AI, experts, and/or collective intelligence, values in collaborative intelligence management and governance, best practices of collaborative intelligence in the public sector, ethical concerns or guidelines for applying collective intelligence, or other similar topics and relevant approaches.</p>

                    <p>This track relates to the emerging cybersecurity concerns and their solutions in the context of the DGO conference’s theme, Internet of Beings. While the Internet of Beings focuses on digital technologies that are people-centric with open platforms for collaboration, they also need to be safe, reliable, and trustworthy. The benefits of various digital technologies, including AI, IoT, blockchain, wearables, and big data can be compromised if these cybersecurity solutions do not get adequate attention. Generative AI, for example, has got much public attention for being biased, lacking authenticity, and simulating human beings in counterproductive ways for public good and even being criminalized. As public agencies transform their operations from face to face work schedules to work from anywhere, they face increased challenges of how to deliver public services effectively. The challenges are not only traditional viruses and ransomware demands, but also false narratives with the mimicry of human beings. Organizations need to be resilient and maintain their operations. Robustness even calls for organizations to be more proactive and sensitive to a range of perturbations from a security perspective. This track will examine the emerging pedagogical, public policy, and organizational dimensions of cybersecurity problems and solutions in this human context of being connected in the digital world. What should public and nonprofit managers do? What are the organizational guidelines to work in this environment? What are the pro and reactive policies that governments could take? How can we design resilient and robust organizations? We invite papers that broadly deal with these questions in the context of public and nonprofit organizations.</p>

                    <p>The Data-Driven Services in Government track aims to investigate how public sectors can complement services and policies through Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) and all kinds of data, such as open data, big data, and linked data, etc. In 2019, the U.S. launched OPEN Government Data Act, taking a step further on implementation of open government data. The other important aspect is how to benefit from government data openess. Creating value from government data is of particular importance to many stakeholders, including governments, private sector, and citizens. But explaining how government data contribute to public value creation has also become a challenge. The Data-Driven Services in Government track invites researchers and practitioners to accumulate scholarly papers that explore the interactions of data application, data governance, and/or data policy, as well as data and public value. Possible topics include strategies for government open data sharing, data-driven services, data principles, value of data identification, creation and assessment, and best practices of public and private sector collaboration on data implementation, or other similar topics and relevant approaches.</p>

Digitizing government adds new layers of complexity to this relation can scale up the positive and the negative impact of government on solidarity, and, in the latter case, undermine its own efficacy. On the other hand, solidarity can enhance digital government by triggering technological innovation, e.g., create tools to help vulnerable citizens during a crisis, or become a goal for such innovation, e.g., foster more equitable distribution of resources. The relationship between government, technology and solidarity is rich and intense and this track aims to bring together cases and reflections on the relation between solidarity and digital government.</p>

                    <p>The concept of a digital platform government can be traced back to the UK's GOV.UK and the Obama administration's Open Government Initiative. There is no agreed-upon definition of the concept, so it is more productive to compare it with similar concepts. The digital platform government differs from e-government by focusing on process innovation and being a public-private partnership service model. It emphasizes active participation of stakeholders and the use of intelligent technologies. Both the digital platform government and e-government models emphasize online citizen participation, but the digital platform government allows citizens to have a more active role in government decision-making. The core public values pursued by the digital platform government include efficiency, accountability, fairness, participation, collaboration, transparency, narrowing the digital divide, and digital equity. The digital platform government is operated in various forms depending on its purpose or the role of the government. Scholars have proposed various types of digital platforms based on their purposes and the role of the government. With this broad understanding about digital platform government, we invite papers that explore the relationship between various digital platform government practices and core public values.</p>

                    <p>Digital transformation has become an essential part of the government’s strategic agenda, both at national and sub-national levels. Such governments seek to offer services through digital platforms with integrated citizen identification systems, digitization of governmental processes, with respect to the privacy of personal data, and digital inclusion of the most vulnerable population. However, digital transformation initiatives at the subnational level tend to present specific aspects when compared to national initiatives. On the one hand, this track highlights the challenges faced by subnational digital transformation initiatives in the public sector, as well as national governments that have acted to develop and integrate national digital transformation considering subnational aspects. On the other hand, it seeks to understand the capacities supporting digital transformation at the subnational level. The track’s objectives are: a) to identify real-world examples/cases of digital transformation projects at the subnational levels (states, regions, territories, provinces, municipalities, etc.); b) discuss the challenges to developing a digital and integrated government considering national and subnational aspects, especially in federative countries; c) seek to explain these cases in the context of existing or new theoretical frameworks, and, d) create actionable recommendations for researchers, professional developers, and digital government practitioners at the national and sub-national level.</p>

Its research papers provide in-depth examination of the associated challenges, ethical considerations, and regulatory and policy frameworks associated with the expanding applications of generative AI in government. Given its rapidly emerging transformations, the track aims to bridge research discussing potential theoretical underpinnings of generative AI implications for government, as well as research addressing practitioners’ experiences with generative AI in public governance. The themes included in this track are grouped in two pillars: 1) Research on the potential benefits of generative AI for government, such as its ability to improve policy making efficiency, personalize service delivery by tailoring services to individual needs and preferences through autonomous agents, enhance public engagement by providing citizens with a more interactive and engaging way to participate in government and receive services. 2) Research exploring the risks of generative AI in government settings, such as its potential to generate faulty information, being misused in citizen-government power dynamics, socio-economic impact, such as automation and job loss in public sector jobs, safeguarding against algorithmic bias, discrimination, abuse of power, among other ethical considerations of using generative AI in government, such as questions of transparency, inclusion, trust in government and accountability. Moreover, the track seeks comparative research papers that explore the emerging global policy interventions as well as legal and regulatory frameworks for governing generative AI in government settings. Finally, the track seeks research papers contextually examining generative AI application within diverse geographies, government settings and societal structures.</p>

Making public institutions open and transparent, and generating public value is a massive challenge that cannot prescind citizens’ participation in the process of thinking, discussing, modeling, approving, implementing, and evaluating public services and solutions. Consultation and participation processes have been bringing governments and society closer. However, there are new challenges to face, significantly in times when the trust of society in governments is compromised in many parts of the world and misinformation and disinformation issues are arising. Consequently, it is paramount to advance on understanding of engagement as an institutional, structural, social, cultural, and political phenomenon, as well as the individual cognitive process to decide to get involved at all levels, from town to nationwide public management discussion.

Because their application entails extensive automation and surveillance, they have the potential to fundamentally reshape the nature of governance in a wide range of public service scenarios. For example, the transition to digital solutions can make it more difficult to assign accountability in public policy and undercut current privacy protection practices. It can also change the incentives for frontline officers in client interactions and transfer effective control over community decisions to private, often for-profit, contractors.

Here, some of the key aspects include polarization of the public sphere, growing claims about the potential harm of social media for our democratic communities, or the potential limitations of institutional communications with citizens because of the lack of trained human resources and government specialists. For this year's theme, we especially will welcome papers related to the conference's central theme – the Internet of Beings focuses on digital technologies that enable integration, are people-centric, and the creation of open platforms for collaborative multi-user to co-create services and products. Particularly, the post-COVID-19 has forced government, private, and non-profit agencies worldwide to find new ways to deliver services, and this is especially important using social media technologies. In addition, we are open to other aspects of governments' service delivery and social media, including theoretical and conceptual advancements, methodological and data innovations, or case and practical implications coming from diverse contexts. We will welcome papers on both traditional and emerging issues, including opportunities, risks, and policies in public services delivery in cross-national contexts, social media motivations to use and audiences, political mobilizations and polarization, social media contents and sentiment analysis, fake news, artificial intelligence and algorithms-based systems and virtual agents in government, instant messaging apps in government, entertainment platforms for political engagement, or social media for crisis and emergency management. Also, we will continue working on including exciting research questions, rigorous empirical studies, and in-depth case studies to enrich the theories, research methods, data, and available cases and practical applications in this research area.</p>

Ph.D. students can submit papers describing their planned or in-progress doctoral dissertation covering any research areas relevant to digital government. Ideally, student participants will have completed one or two years of doctoral study or progressed far enough in their research to have a structured proposal idea and preliminary findings but have yet to reach the stage of defending their dissertations. We expect students at this study stage to gain the most value from feedback on their work and the more general discussions of doctoral programs and scholarly careers. See the detailed announcement for complete information on the colloquium and how to apply. The material provided in applications to the doctoral colloquium will not be published in the proceedings. However, we encourage students to submit finished research to one of the paper tracks or as a poster or demo. Doctoral colloquium applications are limited to approximately ten pages, not including references, tables, and figures.</p>
